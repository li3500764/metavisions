# Twshibainu Ecosystem

1. The video and text user device on both **IOS and ANDROID platforms**.
2. **Tweet to Earn** technology based on blockchain.
3. **Defi** element in order to increase reward and holding benefit/right.
4. **Socialfi ecosystem**: content and experience of users are always the right paths for any project that aims to keep their frequent users. We have already connected one platform (i.e., **Twitter**) and will further join **Facebook** to provide 100% similar content and experience as the original platform can provide. **Twshibainu** also makes an effort to build its own-brand **socialfi platform**, which focuses more on users' production. We try to evoke any resource to create a famous and attractive brand. Users can use **Twshibainu's socialfi ecosystem** to meet their daily **tweeting** needs and gain their deserved reward.
5. **UGC ecosystem**: UGC derives from Web2.0, which means users can use the internet to share their original creations or provide them to other potential users.
6. **Live broadcast ecosystem**: users can choose Twshibainu to share and show their lives or any daily entertainment (such as singing and dancing) and further open the Space interaction mode.
7. After publishing tweets, users can earn **$Twshib** token. The daily benefit is calculated based on a **5% amount of token holds**.
