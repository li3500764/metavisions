# üèß MetaVision IGO InvestorsVFT‚ÄîVGFT

**VGFT is an investor-specific open NFT for the early investment of VIT tokens in the IGO phase of the vision project. IGO investors** enjoy specific **VGFT** corresponding to their investment amounts. After **VGFT** is online in the illusion project, the VIT coins contained in it will be fully released, and users can choose to extract **VIT**. The extracted **VIT** will reduce the release of **VIT** contained in **VGFT**, and **VGFT** can trade within the illusion. At the same time, the corresponding trading market will also be opened synchronously, and users can hold more than one **VGFT**. When the illusion is online, users can adopt different trading strategies for different **VGFT** they hold.
