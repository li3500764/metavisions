# ðŸ“¦ MetaVision Box VFTâ€”VBFT

**VBFT** is an item that is randomly dropped by a user in the revenue mode when watching the video, including a random number of phantom tokens ( **VRT**, **VIT, VGT** ), phantom gem **VDFT**, and phantom badge **VBDT**. Items acquired by users in **VBFT** can be used or traded by category. It should be noted that **VBFT** does not always include war profits. For example, if the user reaches the upper limit of daily **VIT**, the user will not receive the upper limit of **VIT** exceeding the upper limit of daily **VIT** from **VBFT**.

As with **VSFT**, **VBFT** also has five quality levels **( ordinary, rare, epic, legend, myth )**, each account can only have at most four box slots. There are differences between the quantity and quality of warrior products corresponding to **VBFT** of different quality grades, and the quality grade of **VBFT** obtained is not the same as that of **VSFT**. The probability of obtaining a high rare treasure box depends on the rare grade of **VSFT**. This is a probability distribution income binding system, the design of the system helps users to obtain additional probability income reward.
