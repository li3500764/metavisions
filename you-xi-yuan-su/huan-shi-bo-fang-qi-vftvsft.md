# ðŸŽ¬ MetaVision Player VFT-VSFT

### **Method of Obtaining VSFT**

Before **VSFT** is officially launched, users can obtain **VSFT** through early subscription.

On Phase1 online, users can purchase **VSFT** from the **MetaVision** system by **VIT + BUSD** combination. At the same time, illusion will open the trading system of **VSFT**, and users can use **VIT** to purchase **VSFT** from their users in the trading market.

On Phase2, users can cast the offspring **VSFT** through two **VSFT** that meet the grade conditions. The attributes of the offspring **VSFT** are jointly determined by the parent generation and randomness. A parent **VSFT** can cast up to seven generations of **VSFT**, and there is a certain cooling time at the interval of each casting. Each casting requires **VIT + BUSD** iteration, while the offspring **VSFT** can also cast the next generation of **VSFT**. The required coin **VIT + BUSD** is determined by the casting times. Each player involved in casting has a cooling time of several hours. Attention must be paid to the **VSFT** of different camps in order to breed the next generation. At the same time, there is a probability of mutation of high rare **VSFT**, and there is a probability of degradation.

### **Attributes of VSFT**

#### Efficiency of **VSFT**

The efficiency of **VSFT** determines how much extra **VIT / VGT** can be obtained by users in addition to the basic **VIT / VGT**. The higher the efficiency of VSFT, the more **VIT / VGT** users can get per unit energy consumption.

Lucky value of **VSFT**&#x20;

Users may get the mysterious treasure box when watching the revenue mode ( see the mysterious treasure box introduction ). The lucky value of **VSFT** determines the frequency of mysteries in the VSFT box slot.

Moreover, even if the holder of the **VSFT** rents its player to its users ( see below for rental rules ), the holder of the **VSFT** can still obtain the mysterious treasure box that the **VSFT** obtains in the revenue mode, while the tenant does not enjoy the mysterious treasure box. For users who plan to lease most **VSFT** to the market, the magnitude of lucky value is an important and ideal attribute.

#### **Durability of VSFT**

In the revenue model, the durability of **VSFT** determines its durability. A higher durability means a better durability, thereby reducing maintenance. Even if players eventually repair their **VSFT**, they will also pay less repair costs. When the durability of **VSFT** is less than 50 % and 20 % respectively, the player is punished by wear, which reduces the efficiency of **VSFT** to 90 % and 10 % of its full value respectively.

The repair of **VSFT** durability is completed by paying **VIT**. Specific costs to improve durability and repair durability are shown below :

| Title | Endurance | Durability |
| ----- | --------- | ---------- |
|       |           |            |
|       |           |            |
|       |           |            |

#### **Quality of VSFT**&#x20;

The quality of **VSFT** is divided into five levels, namely ( ordinary rare epic myth ) five levels. When users are casting **VSFT**, they have the probability to obtain ultra-rarity creation **VSFT** through blind box casting. The number of Genesis **VSFT** is limited. When Genesis **VSFT** is completed, the offspring **VSFT** can only be generated through user breeding. It should be noted that even at the same level of **VSFT**, there are still differences in efficiency, lucky value and durability during casting generation. These differences are statistically in line with Gaussian distribution.

#### **Grade of VSFT**

The level of **VSFT** is divided into1-30levels. In the first-27 levels, users can improve the level of **VSFT** by paying **VIT**. Users can also choose to use the **VSFT** to accumulate experience value, and each player can obtain a certain experience value every day. Although users can skip the upgrade time by consuming **VIT**, each level of upgrade still needs a day of cooling time to complete. For Level 28-30 jumps, users need to pay **VIT + VGT** simultaneously.

**Player upgrade :**

When the player upgrades to 28 level, it can output a certain amount of **VGT**. When the player upgrades to 29 level, it can output more **VGT** than 28 level. When the player upgrades to 30 level, it can output the most **VGT**.

**VSFT** in different levels have different trigger events. Users need to raise **VSFT** to milestones to trigger level events. Upgrades can increase **VSFT** **** daily base **VIT** earnings.
