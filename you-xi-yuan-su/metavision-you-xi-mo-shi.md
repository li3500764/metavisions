# ðŸŽ° Modes

### **General income model :**

Users can choose the revenue mode to make money through the behavior of video browsing when they use **MetaVision** everyday. Their income depends on two factors : viewing time and the scarcity / attribute of the player ( **VFT** ). Users only need to press the START button to start the revenue mode and select the **VFT** and watch the video. If they do not, the system automatically selects and opens the default VFT for them. Once the day ' s viewing energy is exhausted ( described below ), the revenue model will stop and users will no longer get VIT for the day ' s video viewing ; during viewing, the user can manually select the stop income mode and reopen it when it has an energy value. In non-profit mode, illusion still provides users with video content entry, but users no longer enjoy the benefits.

Please note that the **MetaVision** creates a video entrance in the web3 environment, and the videos obtained by users are not forced to set the **MetaVision**. Users can freely browse all videos of mainstream video websites ( such as Youtube, Netflix, etc. ) in PGC mode, or browse videos created or broadcasted by users in UGC mode and live mode. **MetaVision** hopes to integrate products into users ' daily life and needs.

### **Creative reward mode :**

In the creative user reward mode, ordinary users need to register as creative users and submit video at the same time ( creative users can only submit one work at a time ). There are weekly and monthly awards for creative users, and the winner will receive a corresponding number of VIT awards.
