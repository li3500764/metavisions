# VRT

### Supply and acquisition

**VRT** is a non-uplink currency in the MetaVision system, unlimited supply ; ordinary users receive VRT through daily check-in. In addition to the daily signing of the **VRT**, the creation users can also **obtain the VRT through the channels through which their creation videos are appreciated by ordinary users**.

### Exchange Mechanism

The **VRT** tokens obtained by all users through the sign-in channel can be converted into the **money-VIT** with the same proportion in the system, and the **VIT** can also be converted into the **VRT** with the same proportion for internal consumption in the system. The **VRT** coins obtained by the creative users through the reward channel can be directly converted into digital stable coins ( such as USDT, and its reward is directly obtained from the system reward treasury ), and the conversion ratio is determined by the number of VRT coins received and the user point praise.用户

### Rules

You need to have at least one **VFT** player to use this feature to avoid malicious multi-account access to VRT bonus arbitrage.
