# VIT

### Supply

Unlimited supply, only users in revenue mode browse video access or **VRT** conversion access.

### Profit Mechanism

**Acquisition of tokens** : Users can choose revenue mode to earn tokens through video browsing behavior when they use MetaVision in daily life. Users only need to press the START button to start the revenue mode and select the **VFT** and watch the video. If they do not, the system automatically selects and opens the default **VFT** for them. Once the watching energy of the day is exhausted, the revenue mode will stop, and the user will no longer obtain **VIT** because of the video watching of the day. During viewing, the user can manually select the stop income mode and reopen it when it has an energy value. **In non-profit mode, MetaVision still provides users with video content entry, but users no longer enjoy the benefits.**

**Profit factor :** Their income depends on two factors : **watching time** and **watching the selected player ( VFT ) rareness / attributes**.
