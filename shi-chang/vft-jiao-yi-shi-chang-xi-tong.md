# VFT Trading Market System

**VFT** trading market is divided into **VSFT, VDFT, VBFT, VGFT** transactions. For different **VFT** transactions, **MetaVision** will charge different reasonable transaction fees to support the future benign development and value support of **MetaVision**. Trading market is a security platform for users to trade with each other. When Phase1 is successfully launched and reaches the expected goal, the **MetaVision** authority will not provide any VFT for users, and any transaction between users must be completed. **The overall VFT transaction is deflationary after the official closure of the official VFT channel.**
