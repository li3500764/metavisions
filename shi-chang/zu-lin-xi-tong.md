# Rental System

Each user has a default credit rating when joining the project. The market provides intelligent rental / leasing system. Tenants and **VFT** owners can rent or lease **VFT** immediately by using a button of rent / lease function.

Rental of **VFT** in the market will not cost any renters. Tenants use the one-click rental function to randomly select a “ rental ” VFT from the mall ; the lessee needs to agree to the terms of the **VFT** owner before becoming a binding agreement. The lease agreement period is the agreed time, **VFT** owners specify the minimum number of VITs required within the agreed time. **If the lessee fails to perform the lease agreement, the system will deduct the corresponding score from its credit rating**. If the tenants perform the lease agreement, each time the revenue model is completed, the smart contract allocates revenue according to the lease agreement. The income distribution of the lessee and the lessor is a fixed proportion, given by the illusion system forever. Each successful lease agreement will reward the lessee credit points.
